        <h1>Parkease Parking Service Terms and Conditions</h1>
        
        <h2>User Types</h2>
        <p>There are two types of users:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Wallet Users:</strong> Registered users who have a digital wallet associated with their account. Parking fees are automatically deducted from their wallet balance.</li>
            <li><strong>Guest Users:</strong> Users who do not register themselves. They can pay using the dynamic QR code at the exit points.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Wallet Creation</h2>
        <p>To create a wallet, users must provide the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Email</li>
            <li>Password</li>
            <li>Registered Vehicle Number</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Wallet and Payments</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Upon successful registration, wallet users will have a digital wallet associated with their account. Users can add funds to their wallet using the payment methods available on the Parkease platform.</li>
            <li>By adding funds to your wallet, you authorize Parkease to charge the selected payment method for the amount specified.</li>
            <li>In the event of any technical issues or failures while adding money to the wallet, users may request a refund. Refunds for failed wallet transactions will be processed within 1-2 business days.</li>
            <li>Wallet funds are non-transferable and non-refundable except as required by law. Once parking fees are deducted from the user's wallet upon entry and/or exit from Parkease parking facilities, no refund will be provided.</li>
            <li>Users are responsible for ensuring that their wallet has a sufficient balance to cover parking fees. Failure to maintain a sufficient balance may result in additional charges or penalties.</li>
            <li>The minimum amount to be added to the wallet during top-up is Rs. 10.00.</li>
            <li>Wallet users will receive a flat 2% discount on their parking bill.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Users must ensure that a minimum balance of Rs. 5.00 is available in their wallet before entering a Parkease parking facility. Failure to maintain the minimum balance may result in denial of entry.</li>
            <li>If the parking bill amount exceeds the available wallet balance, wallet users are requested to top up their wallet immediately and try again with the billing process.</li>
            <li>Please note that due to system processing, in rare scenarios, there might be a delay of up to 1-2 hours for the updated wallet balance to reflect after adding funds.</li>
